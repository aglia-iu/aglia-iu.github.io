                <p class="lead">This project was made by Anjali Gali, as a final project for EDUC 5030: Designing Effective Learning Environments.</p>
                <p class="lead">Students who are the children of immigrants, particularly students of color who
                  learned English as a second language, often experience discrimination and
                  ostracization from their communities. Sometimes, this treatment is intentional – for
                  example, students at the school may have never met a student from a background
                  different from them and based on stereotypes they have encountered in public media
                  or opinion or based on stereotypes they have learned from their community, they
                  may perceive this student to be an outsider and may treat the student as such.
                  However, sometimes it is unintentional – a teacher, who may wish for their student
                  to make new friends and begin learning English may ask their other students to only
                  communicate with the new student in English, which can unknowingly make it
                  difficult for the student to adjust or feel comfortable, seen or heard in a new and
                  potentially intimidating environment.</p>
                <p class="lead">
                  If students from immigrant families have the resources, strategies and outlets they
                  need to express themselves, tell their stories, and contribute their ideas and opinions
                  in their newfound communities, communities can become more diverse, accepting
                  and can foster a supportive environment for students to pursue extracurriculars,
                  internships, apprenticeships, and academic opportunities that expand their skillsets
                  and promote self-sufficiency, community-building and self-expression. I aimed to create a training program for students to engage in
                  conversational English and to better understand and support
                  the needs of students from immigrant families and
                  communities. </p>

                    <li><b>Conversational English Lessons for students to engage
                      in conversation with mentors and teachers.</b> This is
                      intended to be a more structured session, with lesson plans,
                      presentations and worksheet packets that teachers and families
                      will complete simultaneously .</li>
                    <li><b>Mentorship sessions for students. </b>This is intended to be a
                      free-form after-school session that offers opportunities for
                      connection between teachers, students and mentors. It is
                      intended to be hosted in regular sessions that occur once a
                      month, with four standard lessons (i.e. lessons that will be taught
                      at the very beginning and end of the session). This lesson will be
                      hosted by the principal/ headmaster of the school, and two
                      instructors at the location, who will administer the curriculum. It
                      will be hosted once a month. While session 1 will offer more
                      structure so that students have an easier time setting up their
                      goals, expectations and strategies for the future.</li>

                  <p class="lead"> For the purposes of this instruction, we aim to create a learning
                    community that is rooted in the belief that members of the
                    community have innate knowledge that they can contribute to their
                    community due to their diverse backgrounds. We want to ensure that
                    this training is modular and can evolve with stakeholders’ needs as
                    those needs change over time. Gunawardena’s emphasis on
                    mentorship provides an environment that empowers learners as the
                    arbiters of their lived experiences. The ADDIE model uses a similar
                    approach; however, this model ensures that development is iterative
                    and systematic. </p>
